# Crime Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains the **Crime Analysis** project completed during my MSc Data Science program. The project demonstrates the use of Tableau for interactive data visualization, dashboard creation, and reporting to analyze crime patterns and trends for law enforcement purposes.

## Project Overview

**Objective:**  
Analyze crime data to help law enforcement agencies understand patterns, trends, and spatial distributions of crimes. The dashboard allows interactive exploration of crime statistics to assist in decision-making and resource planning.  

**Tools:** Tableau Desktop  
**Key Skills:** Data visualization, Dashboard design, Geographical mapping, Time series analysis, KPI calculation, Interactive filtering, Data storytelling  

**Dataset:** Crime data for Chicago (2017–2022), including fields like Case Number, Date, Primary Type, Description, Location, Arrest, Domestic, and geographic coordinates.  

**Files:**  
- `Crime Analysis - Tableau Project.pdf` – Step-by-step process and insights  
- `Tableau project - Crime Analysis.twbx` – Tableau workbook  

## Step Highlights

1. **Overall Crime Statistics**  
   - Created a geographical map of crime locations using Latitude and Longitude.  
   - Highlighted hotspots and categorized crimes by type.  
   - Included live KPIs such as Total Crimes, Arrest Rate, Domestic Crime Rate, and Total Arrests.

2. **Temporal Analysis**  
   - Visualized crimes by hour of day, day of week, and time block (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Late Night).  
   - Enabled trend analysis and identification of high-risk periods.

3. **Trend Analysis**  
   - Studied yearly trends in total crimes and arrest rates.  
   - Compared incident reporting patterns over time to understand long-term changes.

4. **Comparative Analysis**  
   - Analyzed distribution of arrests vs. non-arrests and domestic vs. non-domestic crimes.  
   - Provided percentage breakdowns for better insight into crime outcomes.

5. **Interactivity**  
   - Filters for Year, Incident Type, and Location allow granular, user-driven exploration.  
   - Dashboard layout combines KPIs, charts, and maps for a comprehensive view.

## Result

The final dashboard provides law enforcement personnel with actionable insights into crime distribution, trends, and outcomes. It enables resource optimization, strategic planning, and improved understanding of citywide crime patterns.
